# Bot-API
WIP - API for bots to use. bots for IRC, Slack, Discord ... whatever

## Technology

- PHP 7.2+
- Symfony 4.2+
- MongoDB

## Ideas:

- Register applications (bots)
- Bot sends a command to the API which it answers
- Commands as decoupled as possible (plugins?)
- Administration panel where users register and configures bots (scopes? commands to use etc)
- Register custom commands (webhooks? simple key->value?)
